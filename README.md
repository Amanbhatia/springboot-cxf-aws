# springboot-cxf-aws
This repo contains a sample springboot based webservice and supporting aws files for autodeployment using ansible playbooks

The details about this repo can be found in its corresponding blog entry: http://amansbhatia.blogspot.in/2016/12/creating-springboot-based-rest-web_31.html

The Springboot Java application has been created using maven archyetype. This archetype is also present at: https://github.com/Amanbhatia/springboot-cxf-archetype

The idea is to provide an end to end guide on how to create a spring boot based rest service and then deploy to AWS both manually or automatically.

The aws-beanstalk-ansible folder contains the auto deployment scripts using ansible playbook.
